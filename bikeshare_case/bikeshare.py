'''
Project Overview

The project will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems 
for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The following code will be used to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
Also scripts will take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
